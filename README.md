# AI-Mind

- An app that allows you to see what an AI's mind looks like when you show it an image.

- Built using Facebook's [General Image Recognition DEIT base model](https://clarifai.com/facebook/image-classification/models/general-image-recognition-deit-base) (that was trained on 1 million images and can classify 1000 classes) from Clarifai and QuickChart's [wordcloud API](https://quickchart.io/documentation/word-cloud-api/).
